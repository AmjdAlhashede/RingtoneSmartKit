# RingtoneSmartKit

A Kotlin library for easy ringtone management on Android, supporting multiple ringtone sources and providing a simplified API that does not require passing Context or Activity.



## Features

- Simplified API for setting system and contact ringtones without needing to pass Context or Activity.
- Supports multiple ringtone sources, including assets, local storage (URI), and remote URLs.
- Easy assignment of ringtones to specific contacts via different contact identifiers (ID, URI, phone number).
- Asynchronous operations with success and error callbacks for better control.
- Supports setting different types of system ringtones: call, notification, and alarm.
- Fully written in Kotlin with idiomatic usage and extension-friendly design.


## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file:

```groovy
implementation "io.github.amjdalhashede:ringtone-smart-kit:1.0.2-alpha"
```

</details>

implementation("io.github.amjdalhashede:ringtone-smart-kit:1.0.2-alpha")
```

</details>

## Usage

### Setting a system ringtone

```kotlin
RingtoneHelper.setSystemRingtone(
    source = RingtoneSource.FromAssets("ringtones/my_ringtone.mp3"),
    type = RingtoneType.CALL,
    onSuccess = {
        println("System ringtone set successfully")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        println("Failed to set system ringtone: \${error.message}")
    }
)
```

### Setting a ringtone for a specific contact

```kotlin
val contact = ContactIdentifier.ByPhone("+1234567890")

RingtoneHelper.setContactRingtone(
    source = RingtoneSource.FromUrl("https://example.com/ringtone.mp3"),
    contact = contact,
    onSuccess = {
        println("Contact ringtone set successfully")
    },
    onError = { error ->
        println("Failed to set contact ringtone: \${error.message}")
    }
)
```

### Applying ringtone to any target

```kotlin
val target = RingtoneTarget.Contact(ContactIdentifier.ById(42))

RingtoneHelper.applyToTarget(
    source = RingtoneSource.FromAssets("another_ringtone.mp3"),
    target = target,
    onSuccess = { println("Ringtone applied successfully") },
    onError = { error -> println("Error applying ringtone: \${error.message}") }
)
```

### Setting ringtone via interactive contact picker

You can allow users to select a contact interactively without passing ID or phone manually:

```kotlin
RingtoneHelper.setContactRingtone(
    source = RingtoneSource.FromAssets("ringtones/my_ringtone.mp3"),
    contact = ContactIdentifier.Interactive,
    onSuccess = { println("Contact ringtone set successfully") },
    onError = { error -> println("Failed to set contact ringtone: ${error.message}") }
)
```

### Applying ringtone from local storage (Coming soon)

This feature will allow you to set ringtones from local storage URIs.

```kotlin
val source = RingtoneSource.FromStorage(Uri.parse("content://media/internal/audio/media/10"))
// Usage will be similar to other methods
```
